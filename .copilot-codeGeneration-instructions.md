# GitHub Copilot Code Generation Instructions

## Project: Salla Gamification System

When generating code, please follow these guidelines:

### Coding Style & Standards
- Use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Follow RESTful API design patterns
- Implement serverless architecture patterns (for Cloudflare Workers)
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Create clean, well-documented code with JSDoc comments

### Architecture
- **Backend:** Hono.js (designed for Cloudflare Workers)
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Testing:** Jest for unit testing
- **Multi-tenant Architecture:** Data partitioned by Store ID

### Key Concepts
- **Events:** Actions performed by merchants (stored in events.json)
- **Missions:** Collections of related tasks with points requirements
- **Tasks:** Actions merchants need to complete
- **Rewards:** Granted when missions are completed

### Response Time Requirements
- API response time < 1 second for event processing
- Support for multiple concurrent merchants

### Security Considerations
- Secure multi-tenant data partitioning
- Proper data validation and sanitization

### Error Handling
- Provide appropriate error messages
- Use try/catch blocks for error handling
- Log errors with sufficient context

### File Organization
Follow the established project structure:
```
/src
  /api          # API routes
  /models       # Data models 
  /services     # Business logic
  /utils        # Utility functions
  /middleware   # Request middleware
  /config       # Configuration
  /types        # TypeScript type definitions
  /index.ts     # Main entry point
/test
  /__mocks__    # Mock data for testing
  /__tests__    # Test cases
  /fixtures     # Sample data for testing
  /helpers      # Helper functions for tests
```
